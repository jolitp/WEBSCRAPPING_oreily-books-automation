50,512 books at average 100mb

1G of books = 10 books

10G of books = 100 books

100G of books (uncompressed) = 30G - 50G (compressed) = 1,000 books

10,000 books = 400G

50,000 books ~= 2TB
** time
ten minutes to download a book

6 books / hour

6 * 24 books / day = 144 books a day

144 * 30 books a month = ~450 books / month

450 * 12 books / year = 5000 books / year

to download 50,000 books you need 10 years full time
